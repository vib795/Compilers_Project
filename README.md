# Compilers_Project

This project is written in python3 and uses ply.

To run the project run "exec.sh" using the command:

    ./exec.sh <path to input file> > <outputpath>
                        OR
    bash exec.sh <path to input file> > <outputpath>

The output file is generated in the directory mentioned in the <outputpath>.

Just running exec.sh would write the output to the standard output stream.
